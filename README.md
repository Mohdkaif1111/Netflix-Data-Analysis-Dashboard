# Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard(Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build an interactive data analysis dashboard that provides meaningful insights into the Netflix content library. By leveraging various data visualization techniques, the dashboard aims to explore key trends in Netflix’s offerings, including genre distribution, content release patterns, and ratings. The goal is to enable users to easily analyze and filter Netflix's vast catalog, uncovering valuable insights about the platform’s evolution, content diversity, and global reach. This project also aims to demonstrate the power of Python, data visualization, and interactive dashboards for analyzing real-world datasets.
## Process
Data Collection: Gather Netflix dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or public sources).

Data Cleaning: Use Python (Pandas) to clean and preprocess the dataset (e.g., handle missing values, remove duplicates).

Data Transformation: Perform necessary data transformations (e.g., converting data types, creating new columns).

Visualization: Import the cleaned data into Power BI for advanced visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, trend graphs).

Dashboard Creation: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring key metrics and trends in the data.

Analysis: Interpret visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from Netflix's content library.
